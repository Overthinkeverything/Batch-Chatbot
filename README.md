# Batch-Chatbot
This is my Version of a Chatbot in Batch.It's my first real program. I just learned programming with batch so I don't know if it's good or not. It's in german , but you can train what it answers depending on your questions , so you can train it in english.

GET STARTED:
The bot will learn from you what it can answer depending on your questions.
NOTE: This bot will talk to you in english , but it writes in german.

1.Download this project , open the folder and run JARVIS.bat.
First it will give you a message. You just have to write smth and hit enter.
2.Now the bot is asking for a password. It's "123" but you can change it very easy(just edit the code where I wrote "CHANGE PASSWORD HERE".
3.It will ask you if you want to teach it smth or just talk with it.

HOW IT LEARNS: 
If it doesn't know what you asked in the talking section , it'll ask what you said and what it can answer to this.
It takes the words that you write, and creates a new .txt file. In this file it writes what you write for what it can answer.
So YOU must write with " _ "  (I don't know the english word for that haha). Also , you cannot use special igns like "?" or "!".
But you can write the answers you teach it with every sign. (Pretty complicated ,huh?)

Alright , I wish you guys lots of fun with it haha
